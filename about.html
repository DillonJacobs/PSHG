          <p id="bigabouttext">OUR ORIGINS</p>
          <p class="bodytext" id="abouttext"> Puget Sound Hospitality is a privately held, hotel operation company owned and run by the Pong family. The majority of its investments are here in the United States, in addition to real estate holdings in Taiwan. The Pong family acquired their first hotel, a Travelodge in Tacoma, WA, in May of 1978. One year later, they purchased their second property in Puyallup, WA, which began the Pong family’s practice of building and developing their own properties. 

From 1981–1999, they opened twelve additional properties in the Seattle area, which include the following brands: Ramada Inn, Days Inn, Travelodge, Hampton Inn, Hampton Inn & Suites, Hawthorn Suites and Comfort Suites. In 2005, they opened their first Marriott-managed property, the Marriott Courtyard in Bellevue Downtown. With over 200 associates, the Pong family is looking to grow their organization at the pace of approximately six projects over the next five years.
